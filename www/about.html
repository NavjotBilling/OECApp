									UOIT is home to the Automotive Center of Excellence and boast one of the only automotive engineering programs in Ontario. Because of this, the 2014 OEC will be challenging participants to improve, innovate and revolutionize the way we look at the automotive industry. Participants will face challenges such as fuel efficiency, onboard computer systems and future policies addressing carbon emissions and vehicle safety.

										The Ontario Engineering Competition was originally created by Diane Neil from Queenâ€™s University in 1980. It was called the Ontario Engineering Design Competition (OEDC) and had only three categories to compete in: the Open Competition, the Industrial Competition and the Communications Competition.. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Following the success of the first competition, students from the University of Waterloo decided to turn the competition into an annual event to be hosted by different Ontario engineering universities every year. The competition still had only three categories; however the Open Competition and the Industrial Competition were changed to the Entrepreneurial Design Competition and the Corporate Design Competition. The Communications Competition was split in 1982 into the Editorial Communications and Explanatory Communications.
									</p>
								
									<p>
										The Competition was to continue this way until 1991, when the Sandford Fleming foundation approached the OEDC board and proposed to join their debates with the competition, as they were unhappy with the attendance at their competition. Thus, the University of Waterloo added yet another communications division called Extemporaneous Communications (later renamed Parliamentary Debate).
									</p>
									<p>
									The sixth and final category was added to the competition in 1997 by the organizing committee from McMaster University. The committee decided that younger students needed a way to get acquainted with the competition, but not be at a disadvantage by competing against older students. They created the Junior Design Category, an impromptu design category.
